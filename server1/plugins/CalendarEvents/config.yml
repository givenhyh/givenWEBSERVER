# the following events are for you to understand the way you can produce custom events with this plugin
#   they all get called. You can remove or add any number of events you want. Just make sure that the labels are different.
# to let the plugin do stuff on these events please use the section 'listener'
# if you want to write your own listener, use this plugin as a dependency and listen for 'me.nikl.calendarevents.CalendarEvent'
#   use event.getLabels() to get a list of the labels of the called event
events:
  # event called on the first of every month
  #   as an example: for this event you would check: event.contains("newMonth")
  newMonth:
    timing:
      # this will get called on every first of the month
      #   you can add more dates to the '01' just put a ',' inbetween
      occasion: "01"
      time: "00:00"
  # event called on the first of every week
  newWeek:
    timing:
      occasion: "monday"
      time: "00:00"
  # event called on the first and seventh of every year
  newYearAndSeventh:
    timing:
      # date without a year gets called every year
      occasion: "01.01, 07.01"
      time: "00:00"
  exampleEvent1:
    timing:
      # 'every day' basically gets translated to 'monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday, sunday'
      occasion: "every day"
      time: "03:00,05:00,07:00,09:00,11:00,13:00,15:00,17:00,19:00,21:00,23:00,01:00"
  workingDays:
    timing:
      occasion: "monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday"
      time: "03:00,05:00,07:00,09:00,11:00,13:00,15:00,17:00,19:00,21:00,23:00,01:00"
  # event fired on christmas 2022
  #   for events that get only fired once on a specific date, give the date as dd.mm.yyyy
  christmas2022:
    timing:
      occasion: "24.12.2022"
      time: "12:00"
  everyChristmas:
    timing:
      occasion: "24.12"
      time: "00:00"

# you can listen to CalendarEvent in other plugins. But you can also use the listener included in this plugin
#   to send commands, messages, broadcasts, titles
# use & for colors
# %time% will be replaced with the events time (24h format hh:mm)
listener:
  workingDays:

    # %allOnline%    --->  this gets called for every online player once and it will be replaced with the players names
    commands:
    - "tell %allOnline% &4Hey there %allOnline% &1:)"

    broadcast: "&1Hello everyone. It is now %time%"

    broadcastWithPerm:
      perm: "example.perm"
      broadcast: "Hey man, you got a special permission!"

    # %player% will be replaced with the players name
    actionbar:
      # perm is optional. If empty, the actionbar will be send to everyone
      perm: ""
      bar: "&1That's a cool actionbar, %player% &r(btw: it's %time%)"

    # %player% will be replaced with the players name
    title:
